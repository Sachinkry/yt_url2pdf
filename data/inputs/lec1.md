# Lecture Notes: Rapid Recall Revision for NEET PG

## Child-Related Definitions

- **Posthumous Child**: A child born after the death of the father or parent.
  - This concept can be presented in various ways in questions; focus on the core meaning.
- **Illegitimate Child**: A child born to unmarried parents.

## Childhood Infections & Related Conditions

### General Points & Initial Infections

- **Koplik Spots**:
  - [visual: Spot shown opposite the second molar]
  - Characteristic sign of **Measles**.
- **Period of Communicability** (Frequently asked):
  - **Chickenpox**: 2 days before to 5 days after the appearance of rash.
  - **Measles**: 4 days before to 5 days after the appearance of rash.
  - **Rubella**: 7 days before to 7 days after the appearance of rash.
  - (Other infections have different periods, but these are most commonly asked).
- **Forchheimer Spots**:
  - [visual: Spots shown, different from Koplik spots]
  - Seen in **Rubella**.
- **Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS)**:
  - Associated with a characteristic **triad**:
    1.  **Cataract**
    2.  **Cardiac Abnormality**: Most commonly Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA). Other cardiac abnormalities can also occur.
    3.  **Deafness**: Specifically, sensory-neural hearing loss.
- **Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)**:
  - Key features to identify PDA in a question:
    1.  **Machinery Murmur**: A very strong indicator.
    2.  **Bounding Pulse**.
  - **Closure of PDA in Preterm Infants**:
    - Drugs used: **Indomethacin** or **Ibuprofen** (both NSAIDs).
    - Only one of these options will typically be given. If "NSAID" is an option, it can also be correct.
- **Indomethacin**:
  - An NSAID (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug).
  - Specific side effect: **Headache**. This can be a distinguishing feature if a question highlights an NSAID causing headache.

### Parvovirus B19 & Numbered Diseases

- **Slapped Cheek Appearance**:
  - [visual: Child with red cheeks and body rash]
  - Typical rash seen in cheeks.
  - Caused by **Parvovirus B19**.
- **Parvovirus B19 - Key Associations**:
  - If a question mentions **Hydrops Fetalis** or **Aplastic Crisis** in the context of an infection, Parvovirus B19 is a likely answer.
- **The Numbered Diseases**:
  1.  **First Disease**: **Measles** (also known as Rubeola).
  2.  **Second Disease**: **Scarlet Fever** (caused by _Streptococcus pyogenes_).
  3.  **Third Disease**: **Rubella** (also known as German Measles).
      - _Contrast_: Measles is Rubeola; Rubella is German Measles. This distinction is important.
  4.  **Fourth Disease**: **Duke's Disease**. (Not commonly asked about).
      - Mnemonic: 'D' is the fourth letter, D for Duke's.
  5.  **Fifth Disease**: **Erythema Infectiosum** (features slapped cheek appearance, caused by Parvovirus B19).
  6.  **Sixth Disease**: **Roseola Infantum** (or Exanthema Subitum) (caused by Human Herpesvirus 6 - HHV-6).
      - Mnemonic: Sixth disease by HHV-**6**.

### Scarlet Fever

- Caused by **Group A Streptococcus** infection.
  - _Related Pearl_: If Group A Streptococcus causes pharyngitis followed by a psoriasis-like rash, it's called **Guttate Psoriasis**.
- **Key Characteristics for Diagnosis**:
  1.  **Pastia's Lines**:
      - [visual: Rash in elbow folds]
      - Linear petechial rashes in skin folds, especially the elbow.
  2.  **Sandpaper Rash**:
      - A gritty feel to the skin upon palpation.
      - Presence of Pastia's lines + Sandpaper rash strongly suggests Scarlet Fever.
  3.  **Strawberry Tongue**:
      - **Differentiation from Kawasaki Disease**:
        - **Scarlet Fever**: Tongue is initially white with red papillae ("white strawberry tongue"), then becomes fully red ("red strawberry tongue"). Progression: White â†’ Red.
        - **Kawasaki Disease**: Tongue is red from the onset.
      - [visual: Whiteish tongue with red papillae - White Strawberry Tongue]
      - [visual: Fully red tongue - Red Strawberry Tongue, occurring after white phase in Scarlet Fever]

### "Strawberry" Manifestations in Medicine

- **Strawberry Tongue**: Kawasaki Disease, Scarlet Fever.
- **Strawberry Vagina**: Seen in **Trichomoniasis**.
  - Drug of choice for Trichomoniasis: **Metronidazole**.
  - Metronidazole is also used for Amoebiasis.
- **Strawberry Gums**: Seen in **Wegener's Granulomatosis** (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis - GPA).
  - (Other "strawberry" appearances exist but these three are key).

### Kawasaki Disease

- **Key Presentations**:
  - Child presenting with symptoms of **Myocardial Infarction (MI)**.
  - Most common in children **less than 5 years old**.
- **Diagnostic Aid**: Perform **Echocardiography (Echo)**. Any heart-related issue in a child, consider Kawasaki.
- **Reactivation of BCG Scar**: The scar from a previous BCG vaccination can become inflamed and reactivated.
- **Diagnostic Criteria (Fever + CREAM)**:
  - **Fever**: For more than 5 days (essential criterion).
  - **Plus, at least 4 of the following 5 (CREAM)**:
    - **C - Conjunctivitis**:
      - Crucially, it is **non-exudative**. (Details like this are important for MCQs).
    - **R - Rash**:
      - **Polymorphous, non-vesicular rash**.
      - If vesicular rash (dew drops on a rose petal), think **Varicella** (Chickenpox, caused by HHV-3/Varicella-Zoster Virus).
      - The rash in Kawasaki eventually **desquamates** (peels).
      - _Note on Desquamating Rashes_: Can be seen in Scarlet Fever and Kawasaki. Differentiate based on other features (e.g., MI symptoms for Kawasaki, white-to-red tongue progression for Scarlet).
    - **E - Edema/Erythema**: Of hands and feet.
    - **A - Adenopathy**: Often unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy.
    - **M - Mucosal Involvement**:
      - **Strawberry Tongue** (directly red, not progressing from white).
- **Treatment**:
  - **Aspirin** or **Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG)**.
  - IVIG is generally preferred if available.
  - **Aspirin in Children**: Generally contraindicated due to the risk of **Reye's Syndrome**. Kawasaki Disease is an exception where aspirin is used.
- **Drug to be Avoided**:
  - **Steroids** should be avoided in the initial management of Kawasaki Disease, despite it being a vasculitis. (Most vasculitides are treated with steroids, making this an important exception).
- **Complication**: Risk of **Coronary Artery Aneurysm**.

### Aspirin Details

- COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor.
- **Dose-dependent effects**:
  - **Low Dose**: Antiplatelet function.
  - **High Dose**: Anti-inflammatory function.
- **Earliest Sign of Toxicity**: **Tinnitus**.

## Vasculitides

- **Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis)**:
  - **Typical History**:
    - Old female.
    - **Jaw Claudication** (pain in jaw on chewing - highly suggestive).
    - Headache.
    - Elevated Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR).
  - **Biopsy Finding**: Granuloma.
    - _Note on Biopsy_: A specific number, "Three," is associated with biopsy criteria (likely referring to length or number of samples/segments needed due to skip lesions, though not fully elaborated here).
  - **Association**: Polymyalgia Rheumatica.
- **Takayasu Arteritis**:
  - **Typical History**:
    - Young female.
    - **Pulselessness** or discrepancy in blood pressure/pulses between limbs.

- **Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN)**:
  - **Association**: Strongly associated with **Hepatitis B**.
    - _Contrast_: Hepatitis C is associated with **Cryoglobulinemia**.
  - **Key Features**:
    - **Lungs are NOT involved**. (Important negative finding).
    - Skin lesions, often with ulcers.
- **Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis - GPA)**:
  - **Triad of Involvement**:
    1.  Upper Respiratory Tract (e.g., nasal septum perforation, sinusitis).
    2.  Lower Respiratory Tract (e.g., cough, hemoptysis).
    3.  Kidneys (e.g., hematuria).
  - **Biopsy**: Granuloma present.
  - **Serology**: **c-ANCA positive**.
- **Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA)**:
  - **Key Differentiator from GPA**: **No granuloma** on biopsy.
  - **Serology**: **p-ANCA positive**.
- **Churg-Strauss Syndrome (Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis - EGPA)**:
  - **Serology**: **p-ANCA positive**.
  - **Key Associations**: **Asthma** and/or **Eosinophilia**.
- **Understanding ANCA**:
  - **c-ANCA** (Cytoplasmic):
    - Target antigen: **Proteinase 3 (PR3)**.
    - Primarily seen in GPA (Wegener's).
  - **p-ANCA** (Perinuclear):
    - Target antigen: **Myeloperoxidase (MPO)**.
    - Seen in MPA and EGPA (Churg-Strauss).
- **Mononeuritis Multiplex**:
  - If Mononeuritis Multiplex + Ulcers + **NO ANCA** association = **PAN**.
  - If Mononeuritis Multiplex + **ANCA** association (specifically p-ANCA/MPO-ANCA) + Eosinophilia = **Churg-Strauss Syndrome (EGPA)**.

## Return to Infections & Dermatology (Continued)

### Sixth Disease (Roseola Infantum / Exanthema Subitum)

## Vaccines

### Vaccine Strains (Commonly Asked)

- **BCG**: Danish 1331
- **Measles**: Edmonston-Zagreb (other strains exist, but this is common).
- **Mumps**: Jeryl Lynn
- **Rubella**: RA 27/3
- **Varicella**: Oka
- **Malaria (RTS,S/AS01)**: (Specific strain name not as critical as knowing the vaccine name)
- **Yellow Fever**: 17D

### Vaccine Vial Monitor (VVM)

- [visual: Diagram of VVM stages]
- **Purpose**: To determine if a vaccine vial can be used.
- **Interpretation**:
  - Focus on the **inner square** and compare its color to the **outer circle**.
  - **Use if**:
    - Inner square is **lighter** than the outer circle, AND expiry date has not passed.
    - Inner square has started to darken but is **still lighter** than the outer circle.
  - **Do NOT use (Discard) if**:
    - Inner square is the **same color** as the outer circle.
    - Inner square is **darker** than the outer circle. (This is the discard point).

### Vaccine Temperature Sensitivity & Storage

- **Most Heat-Sensitive Vaccine**: **Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)**.
- **Most Freeze-Sensitive Vaccine**: **Hepatitis B Vaccine**.
- **Ice Lined Refrigerator (ILR)**:
  - Maintains temperature between +2Â°C to +8Â°C.
  - [visual: Diagram of ILR vaccine arrangement, not clearly visible in transcript]
  - **Storage Order (bottom to top, generally)**:
    1.  **OPV** (most heat-sensitive, kept coolest at the bottom).
    2.  Measles
    3.  BCG
    4.  Rota
    5.  **Hepatitis B** (most freeze-sensitive, kept at the top, furthest from freezing element).
    - This order helps protect vaccines based on their sensitivities.

### Open Vial Policy

- **Definition**: A multi-dose vial, once opened, can be reused.
- **Time Limit for Reuse**: Up to **4 weeks** (28 days), provided other conditions (VVM, expiry, proper storage) are met.
- **Vaccines for which Open Vial Policy is NOT Applicable**:
  - **BCG**
  - **Measles**
  - (It's easier to remember these two exceptions than the 10+ vaccines where it _is_ applicable).
